Title: actionAdventurer discarding copper treasure cards

Class: Serious Bug

Date:  8-5-2017
Reported By: Andy Schon
Email: schona@oregonstate.edu

Product: Dominion Game
Platform: flip, Oregon State

Description
--------------------------------------------
Adventurer is supposed to continually draw cards until it has found exactly 2 treasure cards (gold, silver, or copper) and not discard ANY treasure cards, ever.

Steps to Reproduce
--------------------------------------------
1.	Initialize game counts
2.	Put Adventurer card in player’s hand to be evaluated
3.	Set pre and post states equal
4.	Call actionAdventurer
5.	Evaluate if any treasure cards made it into the discard pile

Expected Result
--------------------------------------------
Gain 2 treasure cards and no treasure cards in discard pile

Actual Results
--------------------------------------------
Discard pile contains copper cards. In random testing, this improper discarding causes a segmentation fault and ends the random testing early.

Workarounds
