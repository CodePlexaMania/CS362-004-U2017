To run unittests for:
- unittest1
- unittest2
- unittest3
- unittest4
- cardtest1
- cardtest2
- cardtest3
- cardtest4

in the same directory as the makefile, type "make unittests".

This will compile and run all unit tests and report results into a file
named "unittestresults.out" which can be viewed as a text file. This file will contain all PASSED/FAILLED information for all unittests as well as a code coverage percentage.
