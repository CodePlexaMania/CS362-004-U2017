To run random tests for:
- randomtestadventurer
- randomtestcard1
- randomtestcard2

in the same directory as the makefile, type 
"make randomtestadventurer"
"make randomtestcard1"
"make randomtestcard2"

This will compile and run all random tests and report results into files with their respective
names plus ".out" on the end which can be viewed as a text file. This file will contain all 
PASSED/FAILLED information for all random tests as well as a code coverage percentage.
